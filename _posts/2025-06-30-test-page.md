Once upon a time in a city wired with neon and humming with drones, there lived an old engineer named Mira. She was known for building odd little robots in her cluttered apartment—none more peculiar than her favorite creation: a clockwork cat named Ticker.

Ticker didn’t eat, didn’t sleep, and never chased mice. But every morning, as the sun glinted off glass towers, Ticker would curl up on Mira’s lap, ticking and purring in perfect rhythm.

One day, the city lost power. Elevators stopped, lights flickered out, and the hum of drones faded away. But in Mira’s apartment, Ticker’s tiny heart kept beating, winding down the minutes until power returned. Neighbors gathered, drawn by the gentle ticking and the warmth in the dark. Mira smiled, realizing her little cat was more than a machine—it was a spark of comfort in the hush of the city.

And so, through the longest night of the year, Ticker’s steady purr stitched hope into the silence—one tick at a time.
